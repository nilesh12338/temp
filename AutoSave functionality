Subject: Update on Autosave Functionality Implementation

Hi [Lead’s Name],

I would like to update you that we have successfully implemented the autosave functionality with the following features:

Class-based implementation with enable/disable control.

Browser-based IndexedDB is used for storing data.

Form data storage in object format with AES encryption/decryption using the CryptoJS plugin. The encryption key is a dynamic composite of Form ID, User ID, and Proposal ID.

Old data is cleared automatically – we are maintaining only the current day’s data, irrespective of user ID.

IndexedDB handling is managed through proper connection open and close.

When the Save or Restore button is clicked, the corresponding data is deleted from IndexedDB.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional details or changes in the approach.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

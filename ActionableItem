I will analyze the images and extract actionable items for you. Let me process them now.

I'll first extract any text or key details from the images and then summarize them into actionable bullet points. Let me process them now.

Here are the key actionable items based on the extracted text from the images:

### **1. General UI and Component Standards**
- **Mandatory Fields:** Mark mandatory fields with an asterisk (*) and apply `mandatory-class`.
- **Large Input Handling:** Use `dynamicWidth` for large input values.
- **Field Wrapping:** Use `inputWrapper` class to wrap input fields.
- **Button Naming Convention:** 
  - `send-back-*-btn-class` for send-back actions.
  - `approved-btn-class` for approval.
  - `delete-btn-class` for delete actions.
  - `generate-btn-class` for generating actions.
  - `print-page-btn-class` for print page.
- **Dropdowns with Large Data:** Use a specific class to optimize dropdowns when the data size is large.

### **2. Form and Input Field Guidelines**
- **Form Structure:** Add `formNewDesign` class.
- **Field Alignment:** Use `col-4`, `col-auto`, and `form-floating-class` for proper alignment.
- **Label Wrapping:** Labels should be wrapped in `label` tags with `form-label-class`.
- **Number Fields Handling:**
  - Only allow 2 decimal places for number fields.
  - Ensure max-length attribute is applied.
- **Input Validations:**
  - Max-length attribute is required for all input fields.
  - `form-select form-select-class form-control-class` should be used for dropdown elements.
  - `form-check-input form-check-input-class` should be used for checkboxes.
  
### **3. Field-Specific Formatting**
- **Identification Numbers:** Use designated classes:
  - `tanNumberClass` for TAN.
  - `cinNumber-class` for CIN.
  - `cifNumber-class` for CIF.
  - `panNumber-class` for PAN.
- **Autofetch Elements:** Use:
  - `input-fetch-class` for input fields.
  - `textarea-fetch-class` for text areas.
- **Amount Formatting:** Use `amount-input-mask` for proper currency formatting.
- **Special Character Restrictions:** Use `blockSpecialChars_comm` for restricting special characters.

### **4. Button and Action Elements**
- **Common Button Classes:**
  - `add-btn-class` for adding new entries.
  - `edit-btn-class` for editing.
  - `delete-btn-class` for deleting.
  - `view-btn-class` for viewing.
  - `cancel-btn-class` for canceling actions.
  - `upload-btn-class` for file uploads.
  - `regenerate-btn-class` for regenerating.
- **Previous/Next Page Handling:** Use `prev-page-btn-class` for back navigation.

### **5. Layout and Structural Guidelines**
- **Div-Based Table Structure:** Instead of using `<table>`, use `<div>` with class `formNewDesign`.
- **Expand/Collapse Feature:** Implement `expandAll` and `collapsedAll` classes.
- **Section Wrapping:** Use `section A` and `section B` class structures for form segmentation.

These items provide a structured approach to improving and maintaining UI/UX consistency in the web application. Would you like me to format this into a document or provide further clarifications?
